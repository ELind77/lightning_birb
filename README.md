#Lightning Birb!

Lightning Birb is a small game project created by me, Eric Lind, and my girlfriend, Alice Thornburgh.  It is a showcase for her art and my programming.  The goal of the game is to help a little bird fly home through a storm.  The gameplay is very simple, use the arrow keys to avoid the lightning.  You get three lives and when you run out it's game over.  But you can always play agian :)
